# Hitchhiker's Guide to the Internet

  ## Description
  This project is a guide for hitchhiker's on the internet, brought to you in part by the contributor Ford Prefect scouring the vast expanses of the Webula Interneverse.

  ## Installation
  Much of this project is brought to you by the Infinite Probability Drive and the installation has been diliberated over by, what we have been led to believe, the great minds of a speck of dust that is largely liquid. The installation of this project is likely irrelevant and you oughtn't bother, as your time would be much better spent laying a stick in the path of ants as they transport snips of leaves back to their hill for their queen. 

  ## Usage Instructions
  The usage of this project is a collection of mostly useless information that anyone in their right mind would never desire the knowledge of. However, the vast majority of beings on the speck of dust, which many on the speck of dust refer to as "Earth," although higher minded beings throughout the expanse of the universe have never determined a need to name, if they have heard of it at all. That being cleared up, the beings that do access the Webula Interneverse have determined the best usage of it can only be to simply pass of fabricated stories as fact in an effort to upset the well-being of other for whom they have not met, or pictures of cats.

  ## Contributors
  Many have credited a unseen spiritual being for much, if not all, of the contribution of the project but that is folly. Truth is that Adam Horn, along with Douglas Adams, J.R.R. Tolkien, the cellist in the lobby of the fourth hotel constructed in the shadow cast by the first passing of the moon in the second week of the 1800s, and a mallard named Billy.
